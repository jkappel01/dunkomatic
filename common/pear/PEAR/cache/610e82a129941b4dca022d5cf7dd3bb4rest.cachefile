remote installation through FTP, FTPS and SFTP is now its own package.
This package adds the commands "remote-install" "remote-upgrade"
"remote-uninstall" and "remote-upgrade-all" to the PEAR core.

To take advantage, you must have a config file on the remote
ftp server and full access to the server to create and remove
files.  The config-create command can be used to get started,
and the remote_config configuration variable is set to the
full URL as in "ftp://ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini" or
"ftps://user:pass@ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini" or
"ssh2.sftp://user:pass@ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini"

After this is done, install/upgrade as normal using the
remote* commands as if they were local.";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:28:"/rest/r/pear_remoteinstaller";}}}
